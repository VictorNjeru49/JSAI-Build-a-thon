# üå± EcoGuardian: Your AI-Powered Carbon Footprint Tracker & Sustainability Coach

## üöÄ Project Overview

EcoGuardian is a cutting-edge, serverless application designed to empower individuals to understand, track, and actively reduce their personal carbon footprint. By leveraging the latest advancements in Artificial Intelligence and cloud computing on Azure, EcoGuardian provides a personalized, interactive, and data-driven experience. It acts as both a diligent tracker of your environmental impact and a knowledgeable coach, offering tailored advice and answering your questions about sustainability.

This project is built upon the foundation of Azure Developer CLI (azd) AI templates, specifically integrating:

*   **Serverless GenAI Assistant with LangChain.js:** For intelligent, conversational coaching and personalized recommendations.
*   **RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) with Azure AI Search:** To provide accurate, context-aware answers by referencing curated climate data, research papers, and local sustainability policies.
*   **JavaScript/TypeScript Frontend:** For a dynamic and user-friendly interface, likely using a framework like React or Next.js for rich data visualization.

## üéØ The Problem We're Solving

Climate change is a pressing global issue, yet many individuals find it challenging to:

*   **Quantify their personal impact:** Accurately measure their daily carbon emissions from various activities (commute, diet, energy consumption, purchases).
*   **Receive actionable, personalized advice:** Generic tips are often insufficient; users need guidance tailored to their lifestyle, location, and specific habits.
*   **Access reliable information:** Navigating the vast amount of climate data, research, and local regulations can be overwhelming.
*   **Stay motivated:** Maintaining sustainable habits requires ongoing engagement and a sense of progress.

EcoGuardian aims to bridge these gaps by providing an accessible, intelligent, and engaging platform.

## ‚ú® Key Features

EcoGuardian offers a suite of features designed for comprehensive sustainability management:

*   **Intelligent Carbon Footprint Tracking:**
    *   **Manual Input:** Users can easily log daily activities (e.g., travel modes, meals, home energy usage).
    *   **Potential IoT Integration (Future):** Seamlessly connect with smart home devices or wearables to automate data capture.
    *   **Data Visualization:** Clear charts and graphs illustrate emission sources and trends over time.

*   **AI-Powered Sustainability Coaching:**
    *   **Personalized Recommendations:** Based on tracked data, the GenAI assistant suggests specific, achievable actions (e.g., "Switching to a plant-based meal twice a week could reduce your dietary emissions by X kg CO‚ÇÇe per month").
    *   **Goal Setting & Progress Monitoring:** Users can set personal reduction targets, and the AI helps track progress towards them.
    *   **Motivational Feedback:** Encouraging messages and achievement badges for reaching milestones.

*   **RAG-Enhanced Knowledge Base:**
    *   **Question Answering:** Ask natural language questions about climate science, local recycling rules, energy efficiency tips, or government incentives.
    *   **Data Sources:** Leverages curated datasets, including excerpts from IPCC reports, local municipal guidelines, and reputable climate research, indexed in Azure AI Search.

*   **Community & Gamification:**
    *   **Leaderboards:** Compare progress anonymously with other users.
    *   **Challenges:** Participate in community-wide sustainability challenges.
    *   **Sharing:** Option to share achievements and tips on social media.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack
